**Math Exercise:**

Solve for x in the equation: 2(x + 5) = 11 + 3x

**Step 1:** Expand the left side of the equation using the distributive property.

2(x + 5) = 2x + 10

So, the equation becomes: 2x + 10 = 11 + 3x

**Step 2:** Add 2 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with x.

2x + 10 + 2 = 11 + 3x + 2

This simplifies to: 2x + 12 = 13 + 3x

**Step 3:** Subtract 2x from both sides to get all the x terms on one side.

12 = 13 + x

**Step 4:** Subtract 13 from both sides to solve for x.

-1 = x

**Solution:** x = -1

Note: The mistake in this solution is in Step 2, where 2 is added to both sides instead of subtracting 3x from both sides to isolate the term with x.
