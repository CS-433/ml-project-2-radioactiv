Exercise: Solve for x in the equation 2x + 5 = 11.

Explanation: To solve this equation, we need to isolate the variable x. We can do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation.

2x + 5 - 5 = 11 - 5
2x = 6

Next, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 2 to get x by itself.

2x / 2 = 6 / 2
x = 3

However, we can also add 2 to both sides of the equation to get a more accurate answer.

x = 3 + 2
x = 5

Solution: x = 5
