# Handwriting data creation
This project is our second project for the ML Course at EPFL.

## Overview
This project aims to generate a dataset of synthetic "handwritten" math exercises. The generated data simulates student solutions that can be later recognized and automatically graded. By producing LaTeX-based exercises, rendering them as PDFs and PNG images, and introducing noise and blur, we create a dataset that closely resembles scanned, handwritten documents. This dataset can then be used to train machine learning models for text detection, OCR, and automated grading.

This dataset can then be used to train machine learning models for text detection, OCR, and automated grading.

## Key Features
- **Model Interaction:** Utilizes a language model (via the `ModelCommunicator` class) to generate math exercises in different languages, complexity levels, and correctness states.
- **LaTeX Rendering:** Dynamically inserts generated math exercises into LaTeX templates to produce stylized PDFs.
- **Rich Formatting:** Simulates student mistakes and handwriting irregularities by:
    - Introducing strikethrough text to mimic crossed-out corrections.
    - Adding wiggling text via a special LaTeX command for irregular word placement.
- **Conversion to PNG and Image Augmentations:**
    - Converts the rendered PDFs into PNG images.
    - Adds noise and blur to approximate the appearance of real scanned handwriting.

## Repository Structure

**Key Files:**
- **`model_communicator.py`**  
  Handles communication with the language model API. It sends prompts and receives responses from the model. It also includes a function `clean_answer_format` to extract only the necessary LaTeX content from model responses.

- **`utils.py`**  
  Provides utility functions to handle LaTeX compilation, PDF-to-PNG conversion, cropping, and image augmentation (noise and blur). It also defines template generation for LaTeX documents.

- **`prompts.py`**  
  Contains the `get_math_exercise_prompt` function, which creates a detailed prompt to request math exercises from the language model. The prompt can include instructions for correctness, complexity, and special formatting commands (e.g., strikes and irregular text).

- **`main_script.py`** (or the provided script with the `pipeline` function)  
  The main entry point to generate a batch (`k`) of math exercises. It:
    - Randomizes parameters (language, complexity, colors, strikes, grids).
    - Requests an exercise from the model.
    - Generates a LaTeX file from the returned content.
    - Compiles it to PDF, then converts it to PNG.
    - Adds noise and blur to the PNG to simulate real handwriting scans.

## Dependencies and Requirements

- **Programming Language:** Python 3.8+
- **System Tools:**
    - `xelatex` (from TeX Live or MiKTeX) for LaTeX compilation
    - `pdfcrop` for cropping PDF margins
    - `pdftoppm` for converting PDF to PNG images (part of `poppler` tools)
- **Python Packages:**
    - `openai` (for the language model API client)
    - `numpy` (for noise generation)
    - `Pillow` (for image processing: noise and blur)
    - `dotenv` (to load environment variables)

  Additional packages might be required depending on your environment and OS.

## Setup

1. **Install System Dependencies:**
   Ensure `xelatex`, `pdfcrop`, and `pdftoppm` are installed and available in your system's PATH.

   **Example (Ubuntu/Debian):**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install texlive-full poppler-utils
2. **Install Python Dependencies**: In your Python virtual environment, run:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    (If you don't have a `requirements.txt`, ensure all necessary packages listed above are installed.)

3. **Set Up API Key:** The model requires an API key for access. Create a `.env` file in your project directory:

    ```bash
    echo "API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env
    ```
    Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual API key. Make sure you have permission to use the provided model endpoint.

## Usage

**1. Run the Pipeline:** In the main script (e.g., `python pipeline.py` or the provided snippet in `if __name__ == "__main__":`), the `pipeline` function is called with `k=10` by default to generate 10 exercises.


**Example:**

```bash
python pipeline.py
```
This will:
- Load the API_KEY from `.env`.
- Interact with the model to generate prompts and exercises.
- Create LaTeX documents, compile them to PDFs, and convert to PNGs.
- Add noise and blur to the generated images.
- Store the outputs under the specified `base_dir` (e.g., `example01`).

**2. Adjust Parameters:** You can customize:

- `k`: Number of exercises to generate.
- `base_dir`: The base output directory for generated files.
- `font`: The main and math fonts for the LaTeX templates.
- Other parameters such as `language`, `complexity`, `correct`, `strike` can be modified by editing code in `pipeline` or `get_math_exercise_prompt`.
- 
**3. Viewing Results:** After running the pipeline, check:

    - `tex_content/`: Contains the generated LaTeX exercise content.
    - `tex_files/`: Contains the `.tex` files used for compilation.
    - `generated/`: Contains the compiled PDFs and PNG images. Youâ€™ll find both noisy and blurred variants, simulating handwritten scans.

## Extending the Project

**Prompts and Content:** Modify `prompts.py` to request different types of math exercises, adjust complexity, language distribution, or incorporate more intricate instructions for the layout.
**Model Choice:** Update the model endpoint or API key in `ModelCommunicator` for different LLMs or model APIs.
**Post-Processing:** Enhance image augmentation methods or introduce additional processing steps to better mimic real handwriting artifacts.
**Testing:** Consider adding unit tests or integration tests to ensure reliability.

## Troubleshooting

- **Compilation Errors:** If LaTeX compilation fails, ensure that `xelatex` and the required LaTeX packages (`tikz`, `mathspec`, `fontspec`) are installed.
- **Missing Tools:** If PDF-to-PNG conversion fails, ensure `pdftoppm` from `poppler-utils` is installed.
- **API Errors:** Check that your `API_KEY` is set correctly and you have access to the model endpoint.
