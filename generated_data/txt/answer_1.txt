\section*{Exercise 1}

Solve for $x$: $\sqrt[3]{2x+1} = 2\sqrt{x-1}$

\subsection*{Solution}

To solve this equation, we need to isolate $x$. First, we can start by cubing both sides of the equation to get rid of the cube root:

$$\left(\sqrt[3]{2x+1}\right)^3 = \left(2\sqrt{x-1}\right)^3$$

This simplifies to:

$$2x+1 = 8(x-1)$$

Next, we can expand the right-hand side and combine like terms:

$$2x+1 = 8x-8$$

Subtracting $2x$ from both sides gives:

$$1 = 6x-8$$

Adding 8 to both sides gives:

$$9 = 6x$$

Finally, dividing both sides by 6 gives:

$$x = \frac{9}{6} = \boxed{1}$$

Therefore, the solution to the equation is $x=1$.
